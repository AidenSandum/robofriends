You can easily view the project by cd'ing into the project folder via your terminal and then typing npm start or by executing it in a similar way depending on the packages that you're using.

Throughout this project i learned alot about React, about what it's used for as well as it's History. I learned how to use JavaScript to make responsive web apps as well as the fundamentals behind CSS and also some advanced CSS concepts including grids and layouts and how to manipulate them into creating cool effects and how to utilize them to produce a viewer-friendly product that's easy to use. On top of that i learned how to install different packages and how to utilize different frameworks such as bootstrap, and how NPM scripts work and what they're used for. I also went in depth on how "the internet" works from how addresses retrieve information based on code that are embedded into files and how the internet essentially "read" those files before translating them into things such as "interfaces" and other components that makes the internet what it is.
